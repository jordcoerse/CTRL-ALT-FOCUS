## üçÖ What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and productivity.

**More focus = more secure**

Every task, no matter how big or small, can be tackled using the Pomodoro Technique.

**How it works:**
- Work fully focused for **25 minutes**
- Take a **5-minute break**
- Repeat this **four times** 
- Then take a **longer break of 15 to 30 minutes**

Feel free to adjust the times to what works best for you and your work rhythm.
